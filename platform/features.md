# Platform Features

Chess3 is built as a competitive, on-chain chess platform with real stakes and fair play at the core.

Key features include:

- **Daily Ranked Play Limits**  
  Play up to **10 ranked matches per day for each NFT you own**, capping total emissions while still rewarding active players.

- **Staking on Performance (USD-Backed)**  
  Stake value on your **own performance** or on the outcome of **other live games**, enabling skill-based wagering and spectator markets around competitive play.

- **Fair Matchmaking & ELO System**  
  Transparent rating and matchmaking logic that pairs players of similar strength, reduces smurfing, and keeps ranked rewards aligned with actual skill.

Additional features (tournaments, social tools, and more) will be detailed as the platform moves through public betas and launch phases.
