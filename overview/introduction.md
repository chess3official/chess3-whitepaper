# Introduction

## Chess3: Where Gameplay Equals Earnings

**100 million active online chess players worldwide. Only a handful earn from playing.**

Chess3 changes that.

## The Problem

Online chess platforms:
- Lock earnings behind professional status
- Control everything centrally
- Own your achievements, not you
- Charge fees without guarantees
- Give casual players nothing for their time

## The Solution

Chess3 is the **3volution** of competitive chess:

✅ **Earn from gameplay** - Both winners and losers get paid  
✅ **Skill is rewarded** - Higher ELO = bigger rewards  
✅ **Transparent** - On-chain verification  
✅ **You own everything** - NFTs, earnings, achievements  
✅ **Community-governed** - Players make the rules  
✅ **Built on Solana** - Fast, cheap transactions

## Why Now?

1. **Solana** = fast, cheap transactions perfect for gaming
2. **NFTs** = mainstream digital ownership
3. **Players demand** earning opportunities from gameplay
4. **Web3 gaming** = proven model for sustainable earnings

## The Mission

Grant Earthlings access to interstellar P2E chess shenanigans.
