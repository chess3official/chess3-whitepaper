# Introduction

## Chess3: Where Skill Equals Earnings

**600 million chess players worldwide. Only a handful earn from their skill.**

Chess3 changes that.

## The Problem

Online chess platforms:
- Lock your earnings behind professional status
- Control everything centrally
- Own your achievements, not you
- Charge fees without guarantees

## The Solution

Chess3 is the **3volution** of competitive chess:

✅ Earn at any skill level  
✅ Transparent, on-chain verification  
✅ You own everything  
✅ Community-governed  
✅ Built on Solana

## Why Now?

1. Solana = fast, cheap transactions
2. NFTs = mainstream digital ownership
3. Players demand earning opportunities

## The Mission

Grant Earthlings access to interstellar P2E chess shenanigans.

**Chess + Web3 = CHESS3**
