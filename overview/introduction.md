# Introduction

## The Evolution of Chess Meets Blockchain

Chess has been humanity's ultimate strategy game for over 1,500 years. With over **600 million players worldwide**, it represents one of the most competitive and intellectually demanding games ever created. From ancient India to modern esports arenas, chess has transcended cultures, languages, and generations.

## The Digital Chess Revolution

The digital age brought chess to millions through online platforms, making it more accessible than ever. However, despite this growth, the fundamental structure of competitive chess has remained largely unchanged:

- **Centralized control** by major platforms
- **No ownership** of achievements or in-game assets
- **High barriers** to competitive play
