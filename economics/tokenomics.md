## $GBTZ (Gambitz) Token Overview

The $GBTZ (Gambitz) token is the native utility token of the Chess3 ecosystem, powering all platform activities, governance, and rewards.

**Launch**: Q4 2026  
**Blockchain**: Solana (SPL Token)  
**Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 $GBTZ (1 billion tokens)

> **TL;DR**  
> Chess3 launches a fixed-supply token ($GBTZ) where **100% of tokens start in a DEX liquidity pool** with **$100k of liquidity**. The project then uses **$100k to buy 10% of the supply** from the market and locks those **100M $GBTZ** as the **reward pool for players**. An additional **$200k cushion** supports the **50% platform rake** for ongoing buybacks, making rewards generous for players while keeping the system sustainable long-term.

## Token Distribution

**Token:** $GBTZ (Gambitz)  
**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 $GBTZ  
**Network:** Solana (SPL)

Instead of splitting supply into many buckets, Chess3 uses a **pure liquidity + rewards** model designed for transparency and sustainability:

- **100% of tokens are seeded into a liquid DEX pool**  
  1,000,000,000 $GBTZ are paired with **$100,000 USD** of liquidity.

- **$100,000 separate buy order**  
  An additional **$100,000 USD** is used to **buy 10% of the supply** from the pool.  
  This acquires exactly **100,000,000 $GBTZ**.

- **Reward pool (10% of total supply)**  
  The **100M $GBTZ** purchased by the project becomes the **entire gameplay reward pool**.  
  All player rewards are paid from this bought-back supply – no hidden emissions or extra minting.

- **$200,000 platform cushion**  
  Additional **$200,000 USD** reserve to support the **50% platform rake** and ensure sustainable buybacks during market fluctuations.

**Net result:**

- **DEX LP:** 100% of tokens start in the LP with $100k liquidity.
- **Reward Pool:** 10% of supply (100M $GBTZ) is owned by the project and reserved for player payouts.
- **Platform Cushion:** $200k reserve for ongoing buybacks and market stability.
- **Circulating Supply:** The rest of the supply is held by the market (liquidity providers + traders), not a central treasury.

## Why This Is Sustainable

Design assumptions:

- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 $GBTZ  
- **Reward Pool:** 100,000,000 $GBTZ (10% of supply)
- **Platform Cushion:** $200,000 USD for buybacks
- **Max daily matches:** 88,880 (8,888 NFTs × 10 matches/day)  
- **Payout split per match:** 75% winner, 25% loser

*For detailed earnings simulations and sustainability analysis, see [Earnings Simulations →](earnings-simulations.md)*

### Recommended Payout Per Match

Assuming an initial price of ≈$0.001 per $GBTZ:

| Max daily matches | Recommended daily budget | Gross pot per match | Winner (75%) | Loser (25%) | USD value per match @ $0.001 | Monthly earnings (10 games/day) |
|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------|-------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 88,880            | 177,760,000 $GBTZ/day   | 2,000 $GBTZ          | 1,500        | 667         | ≈ $2.00                      | ≈ $600/month (100% win rate)   |
| 88,880            | 133,320,000 $GBTZ/day   | 1,500 $GBTZ          | 1,125        | 500         | ≈ $1.50                      | ≈ $450/month (100% win rate)   |
| 88,880            | 88,880,000 $GBTZ/day    | 1,000 $GBTZ          | 750          | 333         | ≈ $1.00                      | ≈ $300/month (100% win rate)   |

For 8,888 NFTs, a **1,500–2,000 $GBTZ** gross pot per ranked match is optimal:

- Winner earns **≈$1.50–$2.00 USD** per game.  
- Loser earns **≈$0.50–$0.67 USD** per game.  
- A daily grinder (10 games/day) earns **≈$300–$600 per month** just from ranked play.

*See detailed scenarios including 50/50 and losing streaks in [Earnings Simulations →](earnings-simulations.md)*

This is meaningful, life-changing side income in many countries – purely from playing chess.

### Sustainability Check (88,880 Matches/Day = Maximum with 8,888 NFTs)

Using the optimal configuration from the range above:

- **Gross pot per ranked match:** 2,000 $GBTZ  
- **Winner payout:** 1,500 $GBTZ  
- **Loser payout:** 667 $GBTZ  
- **Daily payout budget (max usage):** 177,760,000 $GBTZ/day  
- **Reward pool:** 100,000,000 $GBTZ

If there were **no buybacks at all**, the 100M reward pool would last:

- 100,000,000 ÷ 177,760,000 ≈ **0.56 days** at absolute maximum usage.

This demonstrates why **game limits are essential** for sustainability.

Now layer in a **50% rake on platform revenue** that is used to **buy back $GBTZ from the market**:

- At 177,760,000 $GBTZ/day gross payout level, a 50% rake implies **88,880,000 $GBTZ/day** bought back.  
- This creates a **self-sustaining system** where buybacks nearly match reward pool outflows.  
- The **$200,000 platform cushion** ensures buybacks continue during market volatility.

With:

- **50% of fees redirected to buybacks**, and  
- **Additional inflows from staking / betting / tournaments**,  

the reward pool becomes **self-sustaining and potentially growing** over time.

### Summary Metrics

| Metric                               | Value                                             |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Gross pot per ranked match           | 2,000 $GBTZ                                      |
| Winner payout                        | 1,500 $GBTZ ≈ $1.50 USD at launch                |
| Loser payout                         | 667 $GBTZ ≈ $0.67 USD at launch                  |
| Daily budget (max usage)            | 177,760,000 $GBTZ (≈177% of reward pool)        |
| Lifetime without buybacks            | 0.56 days at max usage                           |
| Lifetime with 50% rake + cushion     | Self-sustaining with proper game limits           |
| Top grinder monthly earnings         | ≈ $300–$600 USD/month (depending on win rate)    |
| Minimum earnings (lose all games)    | ≈ $200 USD/month                                 |

**Key Insight:** The system requires **strict game limits (10/day/NFT)** to remain sustainable, but provides **meaningful income even for losing players** while maintaining **generous rewards for skilled players**.

Players earn **real money every single game**, even when they lose, while the tokenomics remain **sustainable and structurally deflationary** thanks to continuous buybacks and capped match volumes.

## Token Economics

### Deflationary Mechanisms

**Buyback & Burn from Platform Fees**: 
- A fixed share of platform fees (target: 50%) is used to **buy back $GBTZ on the open market**.  
- Bought-back tokens can be **burned** or **recycled into reward/staking pools** based on DAO decisions.  
- This continuously reduces effective circulating supply and supports long-term price stability.

**Tournament & Event Burns**:
- Portion of premium tournament entry fees and special events allocated to buyback-and-burn.  
- High-profile events = larger discretionary burns.  
- Community can vote on major burn events via governance.

### Inflationary Controls

**Fixed Supply**:
- Total supply is hard-capped at **1,000,000,000 $GBTZ**.  
- No additional tokens can be minted once launched.

**Capped Match Output**:
- Maximum **10 ranked P2E matches per NFT per day**.  
- Hard cap of **88,880 matches/day** with 8,888 NFTs.  
- Keeps maximum daily token outflow from the reward pool strictly bounded and sustainable with buybacks.

**Dynamic Reward Tuning**:
- Match payouts (pot size) can be adjusted via governance based on:  
  - Player counts,  
  - Market price of $GBTZ,  
  - Size of remaining reward pool.  
- Ensures the economy remains sustainable while still attractive for new players.

## Token Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Fair Launch
- **No VC pre-sale, no team allocation** – all tokens begin in the public DEX liquidity pool.  
- $100k of liquidity is added to the pool at launch.  
- A separate $100k buy order acquires 10% of supply for the reward pool.  
- $200k platform cushion supports sustainable buybacks.  
- Anti-bot measures on the platform side (match limits, anti-cheat, NFT gating).

### Phase 2: Liquidity
- Primary listing on DEXs (e.g. Raydium, Orca).  
- LP incentives for community-provided liquidity.  
- Transparent on-chain price discovery via the initial liquidity pool.  
- Optional trading competitions to bootstrap volume.

### Phase 3: Expansion
- Potential CEX listings (target: major exchanges).  
- Cross-chain bridges for broader access.  
- Strategic partnerships and integrations to bring new players into the Chess3 ecosystem.
