# Tokenomics

## $GBTZ (Gambitz) Token Overview

The $GBTZ (Gambitz) token is the native utility token of the Chess3 ecosystem, powering all platform activities, governance, and rewards.

**Launch**: Q4 2026  
**Blockchain**: Solana (SPL Token)  
**Total Supply**: TBA (To be announced closer to launch)

---

## Token Distribution

**Token:** $GBTZ (Gambitz)  
**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 $GBTZ  
**Network:** Solana (SPL)

Instead of splitting supply into many buckets, Chess3 uses a **pure liquidity + rewards** model designed for transparency and sustainability:

- **100% of tokens are seeded into a liquid DEX pool**  
  1,000,000,000 $GBTZ are paired with **$300,000 USD** of liquidity.

- **$300,000 separate buy order**  
  An additional **$300,000 USD** is used to **buy ~33.3% of the supply** from the pool.  
  This acquires approximately **333,333,333 $GBTZ**.

- **Reward pool (33.3% of total supply)**  
  The **333M $GBTZ** purchased by the project becomes the **entire gameplay reward pool**.  
  All player rewards are paid from this bought-back supply – no hidden emissions or extra minting.

**Net result:**

- **DEX LP:** 100% of tokens start in the LP with $300k liquidity.
- **Reward Pool:** ~33.3% of supply (333M $GBTZ) is owned by the project and reserved for player payouts.
- **Circulating Supply:** The rest of the supply is held by the market (liquidity providers + traders), not a central treasury.

## Why This Is Sustainable

Design assumptions:

- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 $GBTZ  
- **Reward Pool:** 333,333,333 $GBTZ  
- **Max daily matches:** 50,000 (5,000 NFTs × 10 matches/day)  
- **Payout split per match:** 75% winner, 25% loser

### Recommended Payout Per Match

Assuming an initial price of ≈$0.0009 per $GBTZ:

| Max daily matches | Recommended daily budget | Gross pot per match | Winner (75%) | Loser (25%) | USD value per match @ $0.0009 | Monthly earnings (10 games/day) |
|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 50,000            | 400,000 $GBTZ/day        | 8,000 $GBTZ          | 6,000        | 2,000       | ≈ $7.20                        | ≈ $2,160/month                  |
| 50,000            | 333,333 $GBTZ/day        | 6,666 $GBTZ          | 5,000        | 1,666       | ≈ $6.00                        | ≈ $1,800/month                  |
| 50,000            | 250,000 $GBTZ/day        | 5,000 $GBTZ          | 3,750        | 1,250       | ≈ $4.50                        | ≈ $1,350/month                  |

For 5,000 NFTs, a **6,000–8,000 $GBTZ** gross pot per ranked match is the sweet spot:

- Winner earns **≈$4.50–$5.40 USD** per game.  
- Loser earns **≈$1.50–$1.80 USD** per game.  
- A daily grinder (10 games/day) earns **≈$1,350–$2,160 per month** just from ranked play.

This is meaningful, life-changing side income in many countries – purely from playing chess.

### Sustainability Check (50,000 Matches/Day = Absolute Max)

Using a middle configuration from the range above:

- **Gross pot per ranked match:** 7,000 $GBTZ  
- **Winner payout:** 5,250 $GBTZ  
- **Loser payout:** 1,750 $GBTZ  
- **Daily payout budget (max usage):** ≈350,000 $GBTZ/day  
- **Reward pool:** 333,333,333 $GBTZ

If there were **no buybacks at all**, the 333M reward pool would last:

- 333,333,333 ÷ 350,000 ≈ **952 days** → **more than 2.6 years** of payouts at absolute maximum usage.

Now layer in a **50% rake on platform revenue** that is used to **buy back $GBTZ from the market**:

- At a 400,000 $GBTZ/day gross payout level, a 50% rake implies the equivalent of **200,000 $GBTZ/day** bought back (at steady state pricing).  
- This dramatically reduces the net drain on the 333M pool and can flip it positive when you add staking / betting volume.

With:

- **50% of fees redirected to buybacks**, and  
- **Additional inflows from staking / betting / tournaments**,  

the reward pool becomes effectively **self-sustaining and growing** over time.

### Summary Metrics

| Metric                               | Value                                             |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Gross pot per ranked match           | 7,000 $GBTZ                                      |
| Winner payout                        | 5,250 $GBTZ ≈ $4.73 USD at launch                |
| Loser payout                         | 1,750 $GBTZ ≈ $1.58 USD at launch                |
| Daily budget (max usage)            | ~350,000 $GBTZ (≈0.105% of reward pool)         |
| Lifetime without buybacks            | > 2.6 years                                      |
| Lifetime with 50% rake + inflows     | Effectively infinite + constantly growing pool   |
| Top grinder monthly earnings         | ≈ $1,400–$1,900 USD/month                        |

Players earn **real money every single game**, even when they lose, while the tokenomics remain **sustainable and structurally deflationary** thanks to continuous buybacks and capped match volumes.
