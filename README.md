## Abstract

Chess3 is to chess what Web3 is to the internet. Built on Solana, it introduces a play-to-earn chess platform where players can earn from gameplay, own their progress, and participate in a community-governed ecosystem.

The Chessalienz: Pawnz collection is the genesis NFT drop that unlocks early access, tournaments, governance, and future rewards across the Chess3 platform.
