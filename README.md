## Introduction

100 million active online chess players worldwide. Only a handful earn from playing.

Chess3 changes that. Blockchain-powered competitive chess where every player can earn through gameplay, own their achievements, and compete on equal terms. Skill is rewarded, but participation is what counts.

## The Problem

### Current Chess Ecosystem Challenges

3. **No Ownership**: Players don't own their accounts, achievements, or in-game assets
4. **High Barriers**: Tournament entry fees without guaranteed returns
5. **Lack of Transparency**: Opaque ranking and reward systems
6. **No Gameplay Rewards**: Casual players get nothing for their time and effort
