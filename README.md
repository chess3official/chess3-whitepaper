## Introduction

Chess has been humanity's ultimate strategy game for over 1,500 years. With over 600 million players worldwide, it represents one of the most competitive and intellectually demanding games ever created. However, the traditional chess ecosystem has remained largely unchanged, with limited opportunities for players to monetize their skills outside of professional tournaments.

Chess3 bridges this gap by introducing blockchain technology to competitive chess, creating a transparent, fair, and rewarding ecosystem for players of all skill levels.
